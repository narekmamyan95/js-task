# Addition vs Concatenation, Tricky JS numbers

Write a function that sums array of prices and returns true if it's equal to `WINNING_SUM`.

When comparing, assume that you work with prices for which 2 digits after the comma is absolutely perfect precision.

## Setup 
1. Clone the repository 
2. Run `npm install`

## Task
The task is considered done if all of your test cases pass successfuly.

To run tests execute `npm run test`.

In case of successful tests you will see this message
```
TAP version 13
ok 1 Test 1
ok 2 Test 2
ok 3 Test 3
1..3
# pass 3
# skip 0
# todo 0
# fail 0
```

If any of test cases fail the task is considered as failed.

### Next steps
Upload the cloned repository into your github account(new repository must be public).

Once you finished coding part commit and push your solution.

Commit message must be `feat(winner): doesCartWinPrize`.
